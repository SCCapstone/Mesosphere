# Mesosphere

Mesosphere is a P2P social media network that uses IDs to connect people and build networks via personal connections. Every individual is their own node and voluntarily builds networks of nodes in passing by others and expanding their networks. You only participate in networks and are exposed to nodes you choose. Data you post is stored and accessed via your phone, offloading the role of a central server across the entire network per each node on demand. Mesosphere will be aimed at iOS & andriod, and released on andriod (.apk) initially.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/)  
  * npm install --global expo-cli  

## Setup

After cloning the repo and installing the above software, users should run 'npm install,' which should install additional dependencies based on our package.json file (there are none at the moment).

## Running

Then, to run the project, run 'expo start' in the terminal.  This will bring the user to the expo manager page.  From there, "Run in web browser" can be selected to the view the app in browser.  Or, users may install the Expo Go app (https://expo.dev/client) to run it on their local mobile device (this requires an expo account and to be logged in on both the host and mobile device).

# Deployment

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

We don't have an apk yet.  Once we've got a framework, we'll eject from expo and see what it takes to make one.  This sction TBD.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
