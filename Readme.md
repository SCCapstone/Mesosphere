# Mesosphere

Mesosphere is a P2P social media network that uses IDs to connect people and build networks via personal connections. Every individual is their own node and voluntarily builds networks of nodes in passing by others and expanding their networks. You only participate in networks and are exposed to nodes you choose. Data you post is stored and accessed via your phone, offloading the role of a central server across the entire network per each node on demand. Mesosphere will be aimed at iOS & andriod, and released on andriod (.apk) initially.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/)  
  * npm install --global expo-cli  

To run the project, run 'expo start'

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
