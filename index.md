# Mesosphere

Mesosphere is a social media network that uses IDs to connect people and build networks via personal connections. Every individual is their own node and voluntarily builds networks of nodes in passing by others and expanding their networks. You only participate in networks and are exposed to nodes you choose. Data you post is stored on a firebase central server, with the hope of eventually migrating this data locally to be shared in a more direct peer-to-peer fashion. Mesosphere will be aimed at iOS & Android, and released on Android via APK initially.

## Features and Screenshots!
Mesosphere hopes to be an app where you can create your own network, free of bots, ads, or any unwanted content.  Other social media spheres are so clogged with machines vying for your attention, we hope to provide a scene where you decide exactly who and what you see.  To get started, simply download the apk, create an account, and add friends who you'd like to stay in touch with.  They'll have to add you back, but don't worry - you won't see anyone's posts but theirs.  This allows everyone to have thier own feed, customized to exactly their friendship circles.
